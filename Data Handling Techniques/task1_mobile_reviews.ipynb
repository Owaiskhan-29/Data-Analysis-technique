Which is very good in this price segment. The phone gets fully charged and in just one hour 20 minutes. It has a dedicated dual Sim and microSD card slot The speakers are good and audio is loud and clear. The front camera or the selfie camera of this phone is good and Performed very well in lowlight. It has slow Motion video recording option which even redmi is not giving so the only phone in this category to give a Slo-mo. It can support HDR content in the videos It supports fortnite battle royale game in high graphics. Supports pubg well...so you gamers out there.....this is a better choice The battery life is good and on average usage it lasts for over a day. Major cons The portrait mode is average. The EIS is not effective as the videos are not that stable The colours are bit over saturated After playing high graphic games for an hour or so there is some heating Build ‚Äì .Realme 3 pro has a polycarbonate body which needs to be protected by a good cover to save it from scratches. But the blue colour is quite attractive with its S shaped gradient finish on Realme. And the cover provided is good enough, no need to buy a separate one Display ‚Äì is great and the colors pop and the bezels are small The processors ‚Äì its good and fast and the apps open fast and multitasking is smooth It has android 9 pie and the security patches are up to Fingerprint sensor and face unlock are both good. The camera is capable of giving good pictures at this price point. The pictures in realme are bit saturated ( you can adjust it while editing) but the performance in lowlight conditions or night photography is lot better. Its 16+ 5 MP lens give very good pictures at this price The front camera of realme is quite good. It can shoot 4K videos and has EIS but videos are not that stable. It has USB port for charging but that's a minor con. Having talked of its pros and cons and with the price dropping further this has become the best you can get in this price point and you should grab the deal without any doubt. Do express if you find the review helpful\",\n",

The VoCC charger is a great accessory and it is actually charging up the device very fast (0-75% in 30 mins) 2. The Snapdragon chipset 710 is powerful enough to tackle high end games like Ashfalt Nd PUBG Mobile. 3. The Color OS is beautifully designed unlike the stock Android OS its has colorful designs and layouts. 4. Daylight photography is quite natural with a slight added saturation on photos which makes them punchy. The surprise 25MP Selfie Camera is absolutely stunning. 5. Dedicated SD Card support + 2 Sim Card Slots Cons :- 1.The back body is the same old polycarbonate though has a shiny finish but the premium thing is missing. 2. No Notifications LED light which is absolutely shocking. 3. The company claims to give 920fps slo-mo videos but trust me its just a gimmick. 4. A mild heating issue is there while playing high graphic games for more than 30-40mins\",\n",
